# ‚ú® Key Features

This project was designed to follow best practices in backend development, focusing on security and maintainability.

- JWT Authentication: Full implementation of user registration (/register) and login (/login) using JSON Web Tokens for session management.
- Security with bcrypt: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in MongoDB.
- Protected Routes: Implementation of Middleware to restrict access to all CRUD routes (/api/tasks) to authenticated users with a valid token.
- Modular Architecture: Code organization based on the MVC pattern (Models, Controllers, Routes), ensuring easy maintenance and readability.
- Data Persistence: Utilization of MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose for NoSQL database handling.
- API Documentation: Integration of Swagger UI (OpenAPI 3.0) to provide interactive, auto-generated documentation.
